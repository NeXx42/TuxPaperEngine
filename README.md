# TuxPaperEngine
Frontend for https://github.com/Almamu/linux-wallpaperengine. Tries to replicate the feel of wallpaper engine on windows.
Uses a fork of the (linux-wallpaperengine) https://github.com/NeXx42/linux-wallpaperengine to replicate some of the wallpaper engine properties like offsets, saturation, and contrast

The main intention was to create an application in which i can use wallpaper engine workshop items with my dual monitor setup.
